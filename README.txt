Jatha is a Java library that implements a large subset 
of Common LISP, including most of the datatypes 
(e.g. packages, bignums).  The API allows access to 
LISP from Java.  Jatha is useful as a fast, embedded 
LISP language, as a set of dynamically-typed data types,
or as a standalone LISP.

Jatha is governed by the Gnu LGPL license.  Please submit
any modifications back to the sourceforge site.
