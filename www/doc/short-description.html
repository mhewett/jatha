<h1 align="center">A Short Description of Jatha</h1>

<p>
Jatha is a Java library that implements a large part of the
core of Common LISP.  It has been used to port a moderately
complex expert system shell from LISP to Java.  It has also
been used as an embedded scripting language.  Due to its
rich set of dynamically-typed data types, additional behavior
can easily be added.
</p>

<p>
There are a handful of open source LISP systems written in Java,
C and C++.  The ones written in C and C++ typically do not provide
a good garbage collector.  Jatha combines the portability of
Java with the built-in Java garbage collector and a fairly complete
subset of Common LISP to provide a very useful LISP environment.
</p>

<p>
Jatha has been in development for over 10 years and has been
used extensively for the past couple of eyars.  It has proved to be very
robust and has no outstanding reliability issues.  Jatha's core LISP 
engine is based on the SECD abstract machine described in Kogge's
"The Architecture of Symbolic Machines".  Each LISP primitive is
a separate Java class and is implemented using SECD abstract machine
commands.  The user can implement new primitives in Java, register them at
runtime with API calls and use them immediately.
