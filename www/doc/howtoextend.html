<h2>How to extend Jatha by adding new functions</h2>

<h3>The easy way</h3>
If you can figure out how to implement it in LISP, do that
rather than implement it in Java.  It's simpler.
Put the definition in a file and load it.


<h3>Extending the Java code</h3>

Since the new function is a LISP function,
       you need to define it as a method on the LispValue interface
       (<code>org.jatha.dynatype.LispValue</code>) and then implement it on
       one or more of the implementations of <code>LispValue</code>, such as
       <code>StandardLispSymbol</code> or <code>StandardLispNumber</code>.
       Put a default method on <code>StandardLispValue</code> that returns a default
       value or throws an appropriate exception if the argument type(s) are not correct
       at runtime.

<h3>Extending the LISP interpreter</h3>
If you just want to call the function from Java, the instructions above
are sufficient.  However, if you want to make the function available
through the LISP interpreter, you also need to do the following:

<ul>
 <li>The LISP compiler (<code>org.jatha.compile.LispCompiler.java</code>)
     compiles the code into virtual machine code.  The virtual machine is
     based on the one in Kogge's book <i>Symbolic Architectures</i>.</li>

 <li>Each compilable function must a subclass of <code>LispPrimitive</code>.  See the
       directory <code>org.jatha.compile</code> for many examples.</li>

 <li>The function has to have a <code>compileArgs</code> method and an
       <code>execute</code> method.  For example, look at <code>GethashPrimitive.java</code>.
       The <code>execute</code> method must push a result on the <i>S</i> register and
       pop the <i>C</i> (code) register an appropriate number of times.</li>

 <li>The easiest thing to do is to copy the Primitive class for a function similar
     to the one you are adding and modify it to call your new function.  This is
     very easy.</li>

 <li>To make the new primitive available to the user via the interpreter, you have
       to register it.  Add a call to Register in <code>org.jatha.compile.LispCompiler.init()</code>.

</ul>
